# Addition , Finally

-	Reduced a big test to a smaller test that represented progress ($5+10CHF to $5+$5)
-	Thought carefully about the possible metaphors for our computation
-	Got the test to compile quickly
-	Made it run
-	Looked forward with a bit of trepidation of the refactoring necessary to make the implementation real
