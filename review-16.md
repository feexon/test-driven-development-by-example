-	Wrote a test with future readers in mind
-	Suggested an experiment comparing TDD with your current programming style
-	Once again had changes of declaration ripple through the system,and once again followed the compiler's advice to fix them
-	Tried a brief experiment,then discarded it when it didn't work out
