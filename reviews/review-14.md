# Change

-	Added a parameter,in seconds,that we expected we would need
-	Factored out the data duplication between code and tests
-	Wrote a test (testArrayEquals) to check an assumption about the operation of Java
-	Introduce a private helper class without distinct tests of it own
-	Made a mistake in a refactoring and chose to forge ahead,not back to green,writing another test to isolate the problem.
