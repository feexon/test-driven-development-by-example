- Made a list of the tests we knew we needed to have working.
- Told a story with a snippet of code about how we wanted to view one operation.
- Ignored the details of JUnit for the monent.
- Made the test compile with stubs.
- Made the test run by committing horrible sins.
- Gradually generalized the working code,replacing constants with variables.
- Added items to our to-do list rather than addressing them all at once.
