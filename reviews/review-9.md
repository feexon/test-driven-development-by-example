#	Times We're live'in

-	Were a little stuck on big design ideas,so we workded on something small we noticed earlier.
-	Reconciled the two constructors by moving the variation to the caller (the factory method)
-	Interrupted a refactoring for a little twist (using the factory method in times())
-	Repeated an analogous refactoring ( doing to Dollar what we just did to Franc) in one big step
-	Pushed up the identical constructors
