# Make it 

-	Didn't mark a test as done because the duplication had not been eliminated
-	Worked forwards instead of backwords to realize the implementation
-	Wrote a test to force the creation of an object we expected to need later (Sum)
-	Started implementing faster (the Sum constructor)
-	Implemented code with casts in one place,then moved the code where it belonged once the test were running
-	Introduced polymorphism to eliminate explicit class checking
