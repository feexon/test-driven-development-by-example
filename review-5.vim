#Francly Speaking#
- Couldn't tackle a big test,wo we invented a small test htat represented progress.
- Wrote the test by shamelessly duplicating and editing
-	Even worse,made the test work by copying and editing model code wholesale
- Promised ourselves we wouldn't go home until the duplication was gone
