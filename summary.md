#Summary
- the problem with the test and code is dependency,you can't change one without another.we can eliminating duplication to eliminating dependency.
- if you can make the steps too small,you can certainly make steps the right size.if you only take larger steps,you'll never know if smaller steps are appropriate.

#TDD cycle - goal[clean code that works]

1. **write a test**.Think about how you would like the operation in your mind to appear in your code.
2. **make it run**.Quickly get that bar green dominates everything else.
3. **make it right**.Remove the duplication that you have introduced to get to quick green.
